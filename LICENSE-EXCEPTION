APRIL USE EXCEPTION 1.0
Copyright (c) 2026 Julian Deller-Yee

This software is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 ("AGPLv3").
However, the Licensor (Julian Deller-Yee) grants specific Additional Permissions under Section 7 of the AGPLv3
to specific users, as set forth below.

1. THE GRANT
You are granted a "Commercial Use Exception" to the AGPLv3 requirements if and only if
you ("The Licensee") meet one of the following criteria:

    (a) You are a private individual using the software for personal purposes;
    (b) You are an accredited educational institution, or a student/researcher
        employed by such an institution (strictly for non-commercial academic research);
    (c) You are a registered Non-Profit Organization; OR
    (d) You are a Business Entity (including all parent companies, subsidiaries, and affiliates)
        that meets BOTH of the following financial criteria:
        i.  Annual Gross Revenue of LESS THAN $10,000,000 USD; AND
        ii. Total Cumulative Funding/Investment of LESS THAN $50,000,000 USD.

2. THE PERMISSION
If you are a Qualified User under Section 1, you may modify, distribute, and convey this
Software (and works based on it) without complying with the AGPLv3 Section 13 requirement
to provide your derivative source code to network users, PROVIDED THAT:

    (a) You do not sub-license this Software or your modifications under any license other
        than the AGPLv3 (subject to this Exception); AND
    (b) You retain this Exception file and the original copyright notices in all copies.

3. NO FORKING TO PERMISSIVE LICENSES
For the avoidance of doubt, this Exception does NOT grant you the right to re-license
the Software (or any portion thereof) under permissive terms such as MIT, BSD, Apache,
or similar licenses. Any distribution must remain under the AGPLv3 + This Exception.

4. TERMINATION & GRACE PERIOD
If The Licensee at any point ceases to meet the criteria in Section 1 (e.g., your revenue
exceeds $10M or your total funding exceeds $50M), this Exception will terminate
ninety (90) days after the date on which the criteria are no longer met ("Grace Period").

During the Grace Period, The Licensee must either:
    (a) Purchase a Commercial License from the Licensor to continue private use; OR
    (b) Bring their use into full compliance with the standard AGPLv3 (by open-sourcing
        their derivative works).

After the 90-day Grace Period expires, any continued use of the Software without a
Commercial License or AGPLv3 compliance constitutes copyright infringement.

5. MISCELLANEOUS
This Exception is granted by the Copyright Holder and does not apply to code contributed
by third parties unless they have explicitly assigned their rights or agreed to these terms.
